# Features
The user can pencil in values by just clicking on a box and typing the desired number.

In order to submit a pencilled value, the user has to select the desired box and hit the enter key. 
If the value is correct, the displayed number will turn black, else the value will remain gray and the user can type in
another value. 

The algorithm initiates when the spacebar is hit. The project contains a visual animation showing how the 
backtracking algorithm makes the choices for the cells.
